## RENT MANAGER APP

### BRIEF INTRODUCTION

Management software divided in three main sections. Tenants, admins and owners.

- TENANTS

Tenants section is meant to offer information regarding tenants lease contract and payments. There's also a functionality for paying the rent through credit card. In the first stage, the credit card payment is simulated, in upcoming versions it may be integrated with some payment gateaway (Stripe, PayPal,...).

- OWNERS

Owners section is a simple site where the owners can check the status of their properties along with the payments and revenues.

- ADMINS

Site for properties administrators. In this section the admin can add properties to the portfolio, manage lease contracts, payments, owners, tenants and transfers. All the users (tenants and owners) are created by the adminstrator.
